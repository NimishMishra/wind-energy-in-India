# Analysis of power generation potential of large Indian wind farms using Computational Fluid Dynamics and Polynomial Regression

The Deccan coastline in India has a great potential for wind power generation, due to balanced wind speed spread over a long period of time. Most of the large wind farms (employing large wind turbines) in India employ state-of-the art wind turbines and are meeting the energy demands put upon them. Other sites, however, still use old and inefficient turbines and are not able to exploit their full potential.

India’s energy demand is set to increase in the upcoming years. It is essential, therefore, to revamp old designs. This dataset is a part of an attempt that aims to estimate the farms’ productivity by simulating the GE 1.5XLE turbines in these areas.

Simulation experiments were done in ANSYS to record the simulation data. A polynomial regression model was trained on this data in order to predict the estimated power output for any value of the input wind velocity. The results were then compared with existing data about the actual power output of the wind farms. Results were documented.
